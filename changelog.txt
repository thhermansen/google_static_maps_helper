= v.1.3.7
* Use HTTPS in google url (by morgoth)

= v.1.3.6
* Removed deprecation warnings `URI.escape is obsolete` in Ruby 2.7 (by morgoth)

= v.1.3.5
* Added support for icon on markers.
* DEPRECATED Google API key as its no longer required when requesting a static map (will be removed from this gem in upcoming versions).

= v.1.3.4
* Paths are now as default encoding it's points with Google's encoding algorithm. Thanks to Joel Rosenberg for providing an easy class to use.
This will cut the length of the generated URL quite a bit; down to between 1/3 and 1/2 of the old size.

= v.1.3.3
* We are now supporting ruby 1.9.1.

= v.1.3.2
* Location will now round and reduce numbers so it doesn't get above a precision of 6.
* Added two helper methods to Location: distance_to(another_location) and endpoint(distance, heading).
* a_location.endpoints_for_circle_with_radius(radius) returns an array of end points making a circle around location.

= v.1.3.1
* Wrote better docs for all classes.
* You can add points to Paths with Path.new(point, second_point, :color => :red, :fillcolor => :blue)
* The "DSL" supports adding paths to the map.

= v.1.3.0
* It is now possible to create Paths which is used to represent lines and polygons in the map. This is not included in the little DSL we have though.
* The map may now request a URL for a specified image format. As an exampe, set map.format = :jpg to get smaller images (but also less quality).
* You can now request different map types, like satellite, hybrid, terrain etc.
* The marker has no responsibility for it's location any more. It hands off the work to Location object if it is asked for anything related to Location.

= v.1.2.3
* It is no longer needed to send in key, sensor and size to the Map's constructor as long as these values are set on GoogleStaticMapsHelper.
* A map does now respond to width and height.
* The map can now receive size as string, array or hash.
* The map will raise an error if width/height is above the limit which Google currently has (640 pixels).

= v.1.2.2
* It is now possible to chain the pushing of markers on to map.

= v.1.2.1
* Bugfix: Sensor wasn't included in the generated URL if it was false.

= v.1.2.0
* Added a simple DSL interface which should make it easier to use.
* Fixed a missing escape of an get parameter.

= v.1.1.0
* Refactored Map class. No longer using internal hash to store the options, but instance variables
* Refactored Marker class. Same as above.
* Wrote better test for testing params the URL returned.

= v.1.0.0
First release. Basic functionality in place which makes usable.
